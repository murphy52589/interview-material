## Star Wars filter

Build an application that allows users to filter Star Wars characters by name

### Requirements
- The list displays a list of Star Wars characters
-  There is a load more button that loads the next page of characters
-  There is a filter that filters the list of characters

### Bonus
- On click of a character, open a modal to show more information about the character

### Notes
- This is using the Star Wars API: https://swapi.dev/
- Using Javascript `fetch` is fine, however in the interview, https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/overview was used
