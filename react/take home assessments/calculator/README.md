## Problem statement
Build a simple four function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) calculator.

### Evaluation Criteria
- UI/UX
- Functional accuracy
- Code architecture/structure, style, and readability
- Code organization and modularity


### Acceptance Criteria
- Handle the 4 basic operations +, -, *, /
- Looks roughly like the design in the images folder
- Display the result of the operation when the equal button is pressed
- Written in React and TypeScript
- Must work like a standard calculator

### Note
You are not required to implement the memory functions (M+/MR/MC), but should implement the AC, +/- and % functions.

### Time 
Please plan to do this assignment in one-sitting and limit yourself to no more than two (2) hours. Even if you are not fully finished, please stop after 2 hours and return what you have completed to us for review and evaluation.
 
While you can use whatever tools you see fit to complete the job, plan to leverage something like Create React App in the interest of saving time.
