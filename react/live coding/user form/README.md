## User Form
Your goal is to create a simple form at the top that allows the user to enter in a first name, last name and phone number, and there should be a submit button

First name: 'Alice'
Last name: 'Doe'
Phone number: '1234567890'

### Requirements
- Handle "Add User" button click event. The information should be displayed in a list below (auto sorted by last name) along with all the previous information that was entered
- Display user information in a list below the form
- Automatically sort the list by last name
- Prepopulate the form with the following data:
```
First name: 'Alice'
Last name: 'Doe'
Phone number: '1234567890'
```

### Note
- I was given 45 minutes to complete the requirements

### Bonus
- Add a delete button next to each user in the list that will remove the user from the list
- Add a search bar that will filter the list of users by first name or last name
- Add a button that will toggle the list between ascending and descending order by last name
- Form validation (things like required fields, phone number format, etc.)
