## Todo List
### Requirements
1. Typescript is required
2. The user should be able to add a new task using an input field.
3. The app should display a list of tasks. 
4. Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed and a button to 
   delete it.
5. When a task is marked as completed, it should be visually distinct from the other tasks (e.g., crossed out or 
   grayed out).
6. The app should handle potential errors gracefully. For example, it should prevent the user from adding an empty task.
7. Consider the user experience and accessibility when building your solution. The design is up to you, but it should 
   be user-friendly and accessible.
8. Write clean, readable code. Structure your code in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.
9. Think about how you would test your application. You don't need to write actual tests, but be prepared to discuss 
   your testing strategy.

### Additional Considerations
- Think about the structure of your application as if it were to grow over time.
- Comment your code where necessary to explain your thought process
