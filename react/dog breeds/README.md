## Dog Breeds
### Requirements
1. Your application should display a loader at launch
2. Make a `GET` request to https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all to get a list of all dog breeds
3. Get a random picture for each breed from https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breedName}/images/random, using the key from the `GET` request in step 2 
4. When all API calls have been completed, your application must remove the loader and display the list of dog breed images
5. Display all the images in a gallery. The UI should be responsive, without a fixed width for the images. 3 dogs per row is a good starting point
6. Hover over an image to display the breed name
   
### Bonus
1. Add a search bar to filter the list of dog breeds
2. Add a button to refresh the list of dog breeds
3. Consider the performance when using the API to load images
