## Colored tiles
### Implement a feature to allow item selection with the following requirements:
1. Clicking an item selects/unselects it. Selected items should be highlighted.
2. Multiple items can be selected at a time.
3. Make sure to avoid unnecessary re-renders of each list item in the big list (performance).
4. Currently selected items should be visually highlighted.
5. Currently selected items' names should be shown at the top of the page.

- Note - in the original task, `items` is intentionally difficult to read. I've refactored it to be more readable. I 
  have left the original code commented out in the `Main.tsx` file.
