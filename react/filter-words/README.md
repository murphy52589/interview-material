# Filtering words

When the user types in an asterisk character, that character matches 0 or more characters in the word list. If there 
is no asterisk, provide an exact match

## Examples -
If the user inputs st*p, words that would be returned would be ``stop, stoop and step``.

For s*n, returned would be ``song, son, songs``
