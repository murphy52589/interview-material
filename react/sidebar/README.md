# Sidebar

This project is a menu drawer (also known as a sidebar) with nested menus (subsections) that can be places in any position within the drawer. There can multiple nested menus, however nested menus cannot have more nested menus. It can be compacted to show only the icons and expanded to show the text.

I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the base for this project and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) instead of Javascript.
