## Sidebar
### This hasn't come up in a live coding exercise yet, but I think it's something good to build
### Requirements -
1. Icons can be passed as props to the component
2. The sidebar should be able to be placed on the left or right side of the screen
3. The sidebar should be able to be expanded or compacted. Icons show when compacted and text + icon shows when expanded
4. The sidebar should be able to have multiple nested menus
   1. Nested menus cannot have more nested menus

### Bonus
1. Unit tests
2. Accessibility
